Having the option to pair, so we can choose the best combination for ourselves
All like RubyMonk
TDD in RM
Being able to talk to Sam in depth in a smaller group (although there was a little confusion with pairing)
Having to explain things in a group is a good challenge (Some find it a bit too difficult to explain things well / to know if you're explaining well)


Dislikes

Finding difficult learning and pairing as we are in different levels
Awkward giving a pair, maybe would be an option choose the own pair
Possibly order of lrthw and RM could be better other way around


Learnt
Learning and pairing without a break is exhausting
TDD in RM
Probably already a method that does that
Better understanding of OOP

Would like to learn:
Unsure how much we should be doing outside course
How to explain things well
